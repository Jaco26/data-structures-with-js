#WHAT ARE DATA STRUCTURES?
  - Collections of values, the relationships among them, and the
    functions and operations that can be applied to the data
  
## WHY SO MANY:
  - Different data structures excel at different things. Some are 
    highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used

## WHY SHOULD I CARE
  - The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need
    to use one of these data structures
  - You've already worked with many of them unknowingly (DOM - Tree)
  - Interviews

### examples: 
    - Working with map/location data?
        - Use a Graph!

    - Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning
      and end?
        - Use a Linked List!
    
    - Web scraping nested HTML?
        - We're gonna be working with a Tree.
    
    - Need to write a scheduler?
        - Use a Binary Heap!
