/*
  WHAT IS A STACK
  - A LIFO data structure

  The last element added to the stack will be the first element
  remove from the stack

  WHERE ARE STACKS USED
  - Managing function invocations
  - Undo / Redo functionality (like in photoshop)
  - Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack
  - We'll use Stacks in Trees and Graphs
